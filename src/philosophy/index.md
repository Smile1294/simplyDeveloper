"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."

<p class="">- Marcus Aurelius - Meditations</p>
<br>

Thinking of this quote, I come across many ocassions where I did not know how to proceed. I was not only stuck, but I was also frustrated thus I was the **Impediment**. However I have this thing I always do, I just think of future. As wiered as it sounds I just usually tell myself "Well this is a tough problem I wonder how it will be solved" and to my surprise it for some reason works. **It never really brings me to solution, but it just lifts some weight of my shoulders per say.**
And frankly I never always find the solution, but I always find a way to move forward. And that is what matters. I think that is what Marcus Aurelius meant by this quote. It is not about finding the solution, but it is about finding a way to move forward. And that is what I am trying to do. I am trying to find a way to move forward always. And I think that is what we all should do. **This applies to everything in life, not just programming although I am talking about programming here**
